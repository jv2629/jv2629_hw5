Problem 1
---------

**Reading in the data and making it workable.**

``` r
file_base_con = "./data/con_0"

file_base_exp = "./data/exp_0"

vec_con = str_c(file_base_con, 01:10) %>% str_c(".csv")

vec_exp = str_c(file_base_exp, 01:10) %>% str_c(".csv")

read_cases = function(file_name) {
  read_csv(file_name)
}

list_con = map(vec_con, read_cases)
```

```

**Cleaning up and combining the data.**

``` r
tbl_con = tbl_con %>% 
  mutate(subject_id = row_number(), 
         as.character(subject_id), 
          subject_id = str_c(subject_id, "c"),
         group = "control")

tbl_exp = tbl_exp %>% 
  mutate(subject_id = row_number(), 
         as.character(subject_id),
        subject_id = str_c(subject_id, "e"),
         group = "experimental")
 

all_cases = bind_rows(tbl_exp, tbl_con)
```

**Spaghetti plot.**

``` r
df_case_ploting = all_cases %>% 
  group_by(group, subject_id) %>% 
  gather(key = time, value = value, week_1:week_8)

ggplot(df_case_ploting, aes(x = time, y = value, group = subject_id, color = group)) +
  geom_line()
```

At week 1 the control and experimental subjects had a mix of values with no clear distinction between the two groups. Over time the experimental subjects all increased in values while controls stayed about the same. The final values recorded at 8 weeks show a clear segregation between the groups. The experimental groups all have values about 2.5 while the controls all have values below 2.5.
