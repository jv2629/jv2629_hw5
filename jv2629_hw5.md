**Reading in the data and making it workable.**

``` r
file_base_con = "./data/con_0"

file_base_exp = "./data/exp_0"

vec_con = str_c(file_base_con, 01:10) %>% str_c(".csv")

vec_exp = str_c(file_base_exp, 01:10) %>% str_c(".csv")

read_cases = function(file_name) {
  read_csv(file_name)
}

list_con = map(vec_con, read_cases)
```
